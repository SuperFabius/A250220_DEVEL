MS-DOS v2.11 support (experimental) for the V20-MBC

Thanks to Kevin Price now MS-DOS 2.11 is running on the V20-MBC!

See: https://github.com/keyvin/v20mbc-msdos

In this folder there are the curret file to try the MS-DOS v2.11 porting by Kevin.
Copy DS2N00.DSK and DS2NAM.DAT on the root of your SD, and change the current Disk Set to MS-DOS with the usual way.

This only works if you have alredy uploded the S260320-R260820_DEVEL1 IOS

Note: the DS2N00.DSK and MSDOS.BIN files are just the current DS0N00.DSK and AUTOBOOT.BIN renamed files taken from https://github.com/keyvin/v20mbc-msdos
